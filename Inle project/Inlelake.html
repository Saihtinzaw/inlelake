<h4 class="h4">History and Background </h4>
<p class="p1"><b>Inle Lake is located in the Shan State of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) in Southeast Asia. It is approximately 13.5 miles long and 7 miles wide with a surface area of about 44.9 square miles. 
The lake is situated at an elevation of roughly 2,900 feet above sea level. It is a freshwater lake that is fed by several small streams and surrounded by mountains.
The lake is also home to several floating villages made up of stilt houses constructed from teak and bamboo.
These villages are built on the lake's marshy shoreline and contain floating gardens where crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and beans are grown.
The Inle Lake region is characterized by its unique natural beauty, with clear blue waters, spectacular sunsets, and scenic mountain views. Large sections of the lake are covered by floating plants. Its clear and slightly alkaline waters (pH 7.8â€“8) are home to a diverse fauna and many species found nowhere else in the world (endemics).There are more than 35 native species of fish, including 17 endemics. Some of these, notably the Sawbwa barb, red dwarf rasbora, emerald dwarf rasbora, Lake Inle danio, Inle loach and the Inle snakehead, are of minor commercial importance for the aquarium trade. Several fish that are not native have been introduced. Additionally, the lake is home to about 45 species of freshwater snails, 30 of them endemic, along with a small endemic freshwater crab, Inlethelphusa acanthica.It hosts approximately 20,000 migratory gulls in November to January. In June 2015, it became Myanmar's first designated place of World Network of Biosphere Reserves. It was one of 20 places added at the Unesco's 27th Man and the Biosphere (MAB) International Coordinating Council (ICC) meeting.Since 2018 it has been designated as a protected Ramsar site. Today the lake's environment is under serious pressure due to pollution, siltation, eutrophication, overfishing and introduced species, including the highly invasive water hyacinth. The endemic predatory fish Systomus compressiformis might already be extinct.

<h3 class="h3">Phaung Daw Oo pagoda</h3>

<h4 class="h4">History and Background </h4>
Phaung Daw Oo pagoda is one of the holiest sites in Shan State and the shrine is huge and features five ancient golden Buddhas. There is the large golden barge, a replica of the one said to have been used by King Alaung Sithu to travel around the country, which makes an annual tour during the pagoda festival to over 20 villages towed by long boats. In 1965, when the boat was carrying these five images, the boat sunk and all of these fell into the lake. People dived into the lake and searched for those and they could recover four of them but one image remained lost. Finally they gave up on searching for the 5 th one and backed to the Phaung Daw Oo pagoda. At that time, they extraordinarly found the lost one in its shrine. Since then, the 5 th one is always remained in its shrine when carrying the images around Inle lake.<img src="images/slider/01.jpg" alt="Phaung Daw Oo pagoda" width="300px" height="250px"> Pagoda festival is annually held an 18-day from September to October during Thadingyut. This festival is the fundamental one to visit for not only visitors but also locals because of the renowned activity; rowing competitions between the villages, using the local one leg rowing style. Besides, you should have a look for incredible experiences around Inle Lake by exploring at the traditional workshops such as lotus weaving, cigar making (cheroot making), Silver Smith, boat making, pottery and Shan paper umbrella making workshops. And also, you can receive the generous smiles by local people.
